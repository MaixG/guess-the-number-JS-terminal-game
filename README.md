# guess-the-number
first project with Upright Ed (BCA)


This project is a computer/user game taking place in the console.

On startup, the computer will ask the user the range they'd like to play within, and if they'd like to guess or have the computer guess.

There is no functionality to protect against Typos, or sanitize data. Any input that differs from the suggested responses will automatically close the game.
